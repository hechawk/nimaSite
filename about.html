        My name is Nima and I am an illustrator based in Cologne, Germany. After receiving my bachelors
in design at KISD (Köln International School of Design) I worked as and illustrator and graphic
designer, mainly for TV and video games.<br>
For the past year I mainly focused on the production of an handmade, animated sci-
fi
show called
„Broke Boy$“ for which I do the art direction and production. Along with my brother and two
friends I co-founded the production company World Wide Web Company and we received a
government funding for the pilot episode.<br>
Thanks for having a look!
